# Complex-Data-Management-Algorithms
This repository includes three complex data management algorithms written in Jupiter Notebook. These exercises come from course COMP7107.   

1 Spatial Range Queries: developing and testing of algorithms for filtering objects while processing spatial range queries. Key point: compute minimum bounding rectangles for polygons, then use MBRs as filters in queries.  (The polygon.csv is too big to uploaded)

2 R-tree & Queries: constructing an R-tree for a set of polygons using bulk-loading. Key points: use z-order curve to sort the MBRs.  

3 Top K Queries: developing an algorithm for top-k queries supporting a command-line argument k, then printing the top-k lists.
